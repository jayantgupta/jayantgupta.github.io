Currently, I am a Fifth year Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities working under the guidance of Prof. Shashi Shekhar. My primary interest lies in field of Spatial Data Mining (e.g., Linear hotspots, Taxonomy-aware colocations, etc.), Statistics (e.g., Effect of spatial partitioning on the measures of inequality.), and Machine Learning (Spatial variability aware neural networks). I love discovering important and actionable information and gain insights about the underlying processes and systems that created the data. I also love to explore ways to build smart automated systems that work on interdisciplinary problems. Currently, I am in the process of advancing the domain of Computer Science from the perspective of smart-cities.

<b>Brief Background></b> I have devoted majority of my college education and industry time to examine data such as, analyzing spatio-temporal traffic movement, summarizing sentiment rich text, modeling real-time industrial sensors and classifying URLs at network layer. My experience in industry has proved beneficial to bridge the gap between my academic knowledge and industrial requirements. Further, my involvement in data exploration has made me eager to learn new techniques to discover relevant and actionable information from large scale data-sets. Previously, I have completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad (IIIT - H) in 2014, Masters in Computer Science and Systems from University of Washington (UW) in 2015 and worked in industrial lab at Bosch Research.
